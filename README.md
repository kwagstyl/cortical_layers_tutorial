# HIBALL workshop on cortical layers 
Workshop materials for using BigBrain atlas of cortical layers

<img src="https://github.com/kwagstyl/cortical_layers_tutorial/blob/main/data/Figure1SixLayersFigure_pixels-01.png" width="500" >


To download the repo with the notebooks and data,

git clone https://github.com/kwagstyl/cortical_layers_tutorial

For visualising the data you will also need to install matplotlib_surface_plotting in python 3:

pip install matplotlib-surface-plotting


Then you should be ready to go!

Example notebooks with ideas for how to interact with the data can be found in notebooks
1. Cortical thickness - visualisation and analyses of cortical and laminar thickness data
2. Cortical profiles - visualisation and analyses of intensity profiles
3. Cortical segmentation - voxel-wise segmentation of cortical layers in BigBrain.

Example solutions to the workshop tasks can be found in the solution_ notebooks.
